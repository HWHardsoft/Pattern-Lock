# simple pattern lock algorythm for ILI9341

This demo shows how to realize a simple algorithm for a pattern lock with an ILI9341 touchscreen and the Arduino IDE.


## Hardware
The demo was written for the AZ-Touch. The [AZ-Touch MOD (for ESP32 DEV KIT C)](https://www.hwhardsoft.de/english/projects/arduitouch-esp/), the [AZ-Touch MKR (for Arduino MKR)](https://www.hwhardsoft.de/english/projects/arduitouch-mkr/) or the [AZ-Touch Feather](https://www.hwhardsoft.de/english/projects/az-touch-feather/) can be used as hardware. Of course you can also simply connect an ILI9341 based touch screen with jumper wires to a microcontroller board and adapt the code accordingly. 


## Usage

Install the following libraries through Arduino Library Manager

Adafruit GFX Library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/archive/master.zip 

Adafruit ILI9341 Library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9341 

XPT2046_Touchscreen by Paul Stoffregen https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen/blob/master/XPT2046_Touchscreen.h 


You can also download the library also directly as ZIP file and uncompress the folder under yourarduinosketchfolder/libraries/

After installing the Adafruit libraries, restart the Arduino IDE.

You can find the latest version of the code and the description of the hardware at https://www.hwhardsoft.de/english/projects/arduitouch-mkr/
